  # == VICKey
  #
  # The VIC cipher is described on the following Wikipedia page:
  # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC_cipher
  #
  # and a working example is here:
  # http://www.hypermaths.org/quadibloc/crypto/pp1324.htm
  #
  # XXX Most of the arrays' content is 1-based mod 10 data
  # (i.e. 0 == 10 and 1 is the lowest)
  #
  # This uses a very complex key schedule as the basis of a straddling
  # checkerboard.
  #
  # Step1 uses Crypto.expand5to10
  # Step2 uses Crypto.chainadd on phrase (after conversion)
  # Step3 uses the previously calculated data by running it 5 times through
  # the Crypto.chainadd method.  The key thus calculated is then converted
  # through a transposition.
