  # == Wheatstone
  #
  # The Wheatstone cipher (not to be confused with Playfair, also from the author) is a
  # polyalphabetic stream cipher represented by a mechanical device with two synchronized
  # rotors just like a clock called the Wheatstone Cryptograph.
  #

  #
  # All in all, this is a sliding system where the plain text "wheel/alphabet" slides over repetition
  # of the ciphertext wheel/alphabet.
