# == Wheatstone
#
# The Wheatstone cipher (not to be confused with Playfair, also from the author) is a
# polyalphabetic stream cipher represented by a mechanical device with two synchronized
# rotors just like a clock called the Wheatstone Cryptograph.
#
# For more details see
# http://members.aon.at/cipherclerk/Doc/Whetstone.html
# http://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/instruments/index.html
# http://bit.ly/983rDL
#
# All in all, this is a sliding system where the plain text "wheel/alphabet" slides over repetition
# of the ciphertext wheel/alphabet.

# == VICKey
#
# The VIC cipher is described on the following Wikipedia page:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC_cipher
#
# and a working example is here:
# http://www.hypermaths.org/quadibloc/crypto/pp1324.htm
#
# XXX Most of the arrays' content is 1-based mod 10 data
# (i.e. 0 == 10 and 1 is the lowest)
#
# This uses a very complex key schedule as the basis of a straddling
# checkerboard.
#
# Step1 uses Crypto.expand5to10
# Step2 uses Crypto.chainadd on phrase (after conversion)
# Step3 uses the previously calculated data by running it 5 times through
# the Crypto.chainadd method.  The key thus calculated is then converted
# through a transposition.
